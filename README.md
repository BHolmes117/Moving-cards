# Moving-cards

Making this project, I was inspired to include this as a part 2 from my recent code I created.

My code would run as you follow through the boolean and array list in the beginning. As you follow the program you start to come across where the images are pulled from the file and randomly inisted into the test. A little bit of the code im the end deals with the hold button being made and determining if a the button is clicked on, the card will stay, if not then it will be switched out. When the program runs, you will sometimes get four cards I do not know why and I could not find a soulution to fix the situation.
